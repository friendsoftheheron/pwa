<h2>Inlog problems</h2>

<div class="p">
    Due to a change in the way the official app logs in,
	<span class="pwa">Power Walk Adventure</span> cannot login anymore.
	
</div>
<div class="p">
	User specific functionality, 
	like hiding the labs you've logged,
	has stopped working.
	If you leave the username and password field blank
	in the settings,
	you still can see the labs.
</div>
<div>
	We're trying to solve this problem.
	It's more complex than expected.
	Any help is welcome!
</div>
